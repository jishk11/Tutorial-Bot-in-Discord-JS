This folder contains the source code for the [Episode 2 - Basic Command Handler Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WahNBX4LjpA&lc=UgwG0HnNSlA_zJ4DDc94AaABAg.9QeB-HAfO1-9U5aHhiS1zg).

Please watch the video before looking at the code to understand how to program the handler and clarify/answer any potential question(s).

<ins>**Note:** </ins>
  - This video (and all the other videos in this series) were made using Discord js v12 and they _won't_ work with Discord js v13. 
     - By default when you install Discord js, it comes with v13. So if you're encountering any errors such as `throw new TypeError ('CLIENT_MISSING_INTENTS');` or `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '??='`, this is because you are using Discord js v13 which won't work with this code.
        - So to fix the problem, check out the solution [here](https://github.com/jishk11/Tutorial-Bot-in-DiscordJS/tree/main/Episode%201%20-%20Basics).
          - In the future, I will update the series with new Discord js v13 videos.
