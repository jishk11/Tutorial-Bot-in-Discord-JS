This folder contains the source code for the [Episode 7 - Welcome Role](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBcuHdK8N2Q).

Please watch the video before looking at the code to understand how to program the handler and clarify/answer any potential question(s).

## <ins>**Note:** </ins> ##
  - This video was made using the advanced command handler which was made in [Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AwHvRzX4QY&t=3s).
  - Place the `guildMemberAdd.js` file in your "guild" folder which should be inside of your "events" folder.
    - Please refer to the image below if you're confused where to place this file.

  - Additionally, this video (and all the other videos in this series) were made using Discord js v12 and they _won't_ work with Discord js v13. 
     - **So if you're following along with this video and you are getting errors such as** `throw new TypeError ('CLIENT_MISSING_INTENTS');` or `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '??='`, **check out the solution to that** [here](https://github.com/jishk11/Tutorial-Bot-in-DiscordJS/tree/main/Episode%201%20-%20Basics).
          - In the future, I will update the series with new Discord js v13 videos.
